### What is an API?

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to communicate with each other, enabling different software systems to exchange information and perform various functions.

### What is a REST API?

REST (Representational State Transfer) API is a type of web service that adheres to the principles of REST architecture. REST APIs allow communication between client and server applications over HTTP, using standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.

#### Key Principles of REST

1. **Stateless**: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server does not store any client context between requests.

2. **Client-Server Architecture**: The client and server are separated, allowing them to evolve independently. The client handles the user interface and the server manages data and business logic.

3. **Cacheable**: Responses from the server can be marked as cacheable or non-cacheable. If cacheable, clients can reuse the response data for subsequent requests, improving performance.

4. **Uniform Interface**: REST APIs have a uniform interface that simplifies and decouples the architecture, which allows each part to evolve independently. The uniform interface is typically implemented with:
   - **Resource Identification**: Resources are identified in requests using URIs.
   - **Resource Manipulation**: Resources are manipulated through representations (e.g., JSON, XML).
   - **Self-descriptive Messages**: Each message includes enough information to describe how to process the message.
   - **Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)**: Clients interact with resources entirely through hypermedia provided dynamically by application servers.

5. **Layered System**: A client cannot ordinarily tell whether it is connected directly to the end server or to an intermediary along the way. This can improve scalability by enabling load balancing and shared caches.

#### HTTP Methods

- **GET**: Retrieve data from the server. (Read)
- **POST**: Submit data to the server, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server. (Create)
- **PUT**: Replace all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content. (Update/Replace)
- **PATCH**: Apply partial modifications to a resource. (Update/Modify)
- **DELETE**: Remove the specified resource from the server. (Delete)

#### Resources and URIs

In REST, resources (e.g., users, posts, products) are identified by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). For example, in a blog application:
- `GET /posts` might retrieve a list of blog posts.
- `GET /posts/1` might retrieve a single blog post with ID 1.
- `POST /posts` might create a new blog post.
- `PUT /posts/1` might update the blog post with ID 1.
- `DELETE /posts/1` might delete the blog post with ID 1.

#### Example of a REST API

Consider a simple REST API for managing a list of books:

##### GET /books
Retrieve a list of books:
```json
[
    {"id": 1, "title": "1984", "author": "George Orwell"},
    {"id": 2, "title": "To Kill a Mockingbird", "author": "Harper Lee"}
]
